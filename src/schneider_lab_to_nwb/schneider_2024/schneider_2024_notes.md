## Behavior
- opto events is just [0, 1] like empty variables (lick events), and opto_time in 'push' is all NaNs.  Where is the actual opto stim times recorded?
- TuningTones has a values field with integers, what does this correspond to?
- 'push' is basically some kind of trials table, but need descriptions for variables ex. ITI_respect?

## Video
- In research overview, 3 cameras are mentioned, but only 2 appear in example data. Missing camera? Or incorrect description?

## Data Requests
- Mice sexes
- Remaining data for Grant's project
- More detailed position info for recording probe
    - stereotactic coordinates of the whole probe
- Detailed description of the behavioral paradigm
- Description of lickometer and lever/treadmill quadrature encoder.
- Detailed description of temporal alignment procedure.
