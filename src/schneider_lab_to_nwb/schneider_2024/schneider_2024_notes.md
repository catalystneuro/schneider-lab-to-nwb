## Behavior

## Video

## Intrinsic Signal Optical Imaging
- Just including raw blood vessel image and processed overlay + pixel locations bc including the isoi roi response series would really require an extension for context, but seems like it has limited reuse potential.
- Need more detailed description of topographic lines in overlay image.
- Need pixel locs for ephys

## Data Requests
- Mice sexes
- Remaining data for Grant's project
- More detailed position info for recording probe
- Detailed description of temporal alignment procedure.
