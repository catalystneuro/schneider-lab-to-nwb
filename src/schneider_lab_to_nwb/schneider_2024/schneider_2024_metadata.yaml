  experiment_description:
    Identifying mistakes is important for improving performance during acoustic behaviors like speech and musicianship. Although hearing is instrumental for monitoring and adapting these behaviors, the neural circuits that integrate motor, acoustic, and goal-related signals to detect errors and guide ongoing sensorimotor adaptation in mammals remain unidentified. Here, we develop a novel closed-loop, sound-guided behavior that requires mice to use real-time acoustic feedback to guide skilled ongoing forelimb movements. Large scale electrophysiology recordings reveal that the mouse auditory cortex integrates information about sound and movement, as well as encodes error- and learning-related signals during this sound-generating behavior. Distinct groups of auditory cortex neurons signal different error types, and the activity of these neurons predicts both within-trial and across-trial behavioral adaptations. Brief, behavior-triggered optogenetic suppression of auditory cortex during error signaling hinders behavioral corrections on both rapid and long time scales, indicating that cortical error signals are necessary for skilled acoustic behaviors. Together, these experiments identify a cortical role for detecting errors and learning from mistakes and suggest that the auditory cortex plays a critical role in skilled, sound-generating behavior in mammals.

  description: 12-week-old C57BL/6 or VGATChR2-EYFP mice (see Aims approaches below for details) will be used for all behavioral, electrophysiology, and optogenetic experiments. In the VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mouse line, channelrhodopsin (ChR2) is coupled to the vesicular GABA transporter, inducing expression in GABAergic inhibitory neurons ubiquitously across cortex and allowing for real time optogenetic inhibition of brain regions of interest.

Behavior:
  Module:
    name: behavior
    description: C57BL/6 mice will first be water restricted, habituated to head fixation in the behavioral set up for two days and classically conditioned to associate a 16 kHz tone with a small water reward given 150 ms after the tone plays (~12 seconds inter-tone-interval). Mice will then be trained for 15 to 20 sessions on an auditory guided task described as follows. Inspired by human performance on stringed instruments, whereby a target note is achieved via modulation of forelimb and hand movements, we have engineered a novel behavioral paradigm that requires mice to skillfully adjust the size of lever presses in response to a dynamic virtual acoustic environment. Mice are trained to press a small 3-D printed lever forward with their forelimb toward a 2 mm wide target zone. Mice hear a 16 Hz tone when the lever enters the zone and a 10 kHz tone if the press exceeds the bounds of the zone. Presses that peak within the zone produce only the entry tone and are rewarded when the lever returns to the starting position. Presses that undershoot (producing no tones) or overshoot (producing both an entry and an exit tone) are unrewarded. Every 30 trials, which we refer to as a block, the target zone is relocated without warning and the mice must use acoustic feedback to adjust their lever presses to peak at the new location.
