# Notes concerning the corredera_2025 conversion

## Behavior
- Lots of relevant variables in the .mat files
- Need subject_id, age, strain, description, etc.

## Video
- Need make and model for FLIR camera

## Optogenetics
- Do these experiments include optogenetic data?

## Intrinsic Signal Optical Imaging
- Do these experiments include ISOI?

## Ephys
- Need brain region
- Need channel_positions.npy
- Need probe info, is it also a Masminidis Lab probe?
- Raw binary file uses .bin extension instead of .dat (or .continuous)
- Need settings.xml and (probably) the structure.oebin file to read the data properly -- maybe just send the full folder of output files from OpenEphys

## Sleap
- Output file not loading in sleap interface for some reason -- missing 'tracks_json'...
