# Notes concerning the corredera_2025 conversion

## Behavior
- Lots of relevant variables in the .mat files
- Based on the SfN poster, it looks like there are at least 4 different types of sessions:
    1. 60 min exploration on leaves/rubber (top left)
    2. exploration on VR environment (bottom left)
    3. 3-set session with self-generated playback (middle)
    4. exploration with Loom threat (right)
shared data looks like session type 1.
