  experiment_description: Experiments involve recording audio, video and electrophisiology data from the auditory cortex as mice walk on a squared arena with different surfaces for 1 hour. After this period, a series of "threats" are presented, including both visual and auditory cues to induce a fear response. The goal is to quantify both behavior and neuronal responses to self-generated sounds (footsteps on different surfaces) over time, particularly under varying levels of predatory risk.

Session:
  - name: natural_exploration
    description: Mice explored a square arena with a natural substrate (leaves) and an artificial surface (rubber) for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded.
  - name: vr_exploration
    description: Mice explored a square arena in which virtual-reality self-generated sounds were played back to them only in the VR half of the arena for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded.
  - name: playback
    description: Mice explored a square arena with a natural substrate (leaves) and an artificial surface (rubber) for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded. During this time, virtual-reality self-generated sounds were played back to the mice in the arena in three 10-minute sets interleaved with 10-minute pre-sets without audio playback.
  - name: loom_threat
    description: Mice explored a square arena in which virtual-reality self-generated sounds were played back to them only in the VR half of the arena for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded. After this period, a series of threats were presented, including both visual and auditory cues, for 10 minutes.

#   Module:
#     name: behavior
#     description: C57BL/6 mice were first be water restricted, habituated to head fixation in the behavioral set up for two days and classically conditioned to associate a 16 kHz tone with a small water reward given 150 ms after the tone plays (~12 seconds inter-tone-interval). Mice were then be trained for 15 to 20 sessions on an auditory guided task described as follows. Inspired by human performance on stringed instruments, whereby a target note is achieved via modulation of forelimb and hand movements, we have engineered a novel behavioral paradigm that requires mice to skillfully adjust the size of lever presses in response to a dynamic virtual acoustic environment. Mice were trained to press a small 3-D printed lever forward with their forelimb toward a 2 mm wide target zone. Mice heard a 16 Hz tone when the lever enters the zone and a 10 kHz tone if the press exceeds the bounds of the zone. Presses that peak within the zone produce only the entry tone and are rewarded when the lever returns to the starting position. Presses that undershoot (producing no tones) or overshoot (producing both an entry and an exit tone) are unrewarded. Every 30 trials, which we refer to as a block, the target zone was relocated without warning and the mice must use acoustic feedback to adjust their lever presses to peak at the new location.

Digital signals for licking and lever movement were collected by a data acquisition card (National Instruments) connected to a computer and logged by custom Matlab software (Mathworks, PsychToolBox) and sampled at 2kHz.
