  experiment_description: Experiments involve recording audio, video and electrophisiology data from the auditory cortex as mice walk on a squared arena with different surfaces for 1 hour. After this period, a series of "threats" are presented, including both visual and auditory cues to induce a fear response. The goal is to quantify both behavior and neuronal responses to self-generated sounds (footsteps on different surfaces) over time, particularly under varying levels of predatory risk.

    description: Mice explored a square arena with a natural substrate (leaves) and an artificial surface (rubber) for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded.
  - name: vr_exploration
    description: Mice explored a square arena in which virtual-reality self-generated sounds were played back to them only in the VR half of the arena for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded.
  - name: playback
    description: Mice explored a square arena with a natural substrate (leaves) and an artificial surface (rubber) for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded. During this time, virtual-reality self-generated sounds were played back to the mice in the arena in three 10-minute sets interleaved with 10-minute pre-sets without audio playback.
  - name: loom_threat
    description: Mice explored a square arena in which virtual-reality self-generated sounds were played back to them only in the VR half of the arena for 60 minutes while audio, video, and auditory cortex electrophysiological activity were recorded. After this period, a series of threats were presented, including both visual and auditory cues, for 10 minutes.
